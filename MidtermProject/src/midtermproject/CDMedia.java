    Description of program, & explanation of programming concept(s) being  applied in program:
    * Read a file with a catalog of CDs or DVDs, and create an ArrayList of media objects with either CDMedia or DVDMedia objects.
    * Implement the Comparable and Comparator interfaces to organize the media objects by mediaName or artistName.
    * Use binarySearch to find the media or the artist given by the user.
    * Add new media to the catalog file.

 * This is the subclass CDMedia. It inherits the artistName and mediaName variables from its superclass media and creates a new instance variable, which is an ArrayList of Strings named songs.
 * It also has its corresponding constructor, setters, getters and toString methods.
